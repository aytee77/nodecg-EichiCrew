This layout is used for [UMEBURA](http://piosuma.blog.jp/).  
The light version count score as a light bar.  
I change this layout from jQuery/StreamControl to Vue.js/NodeCG version.  
light version only support BO3/5.  
use number version if you want to do a crew battle (or score > 3)

### HIROSUMA Style - stock icon

This layout is similar to UMEBURA.  
But it use stock icon to create a more fantastic layout.
